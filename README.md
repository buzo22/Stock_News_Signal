## Introduction

This program uses APIs to search for stock signals via the stock market. 

## Aim

The aim is to determine when a determined stock is Up or Low and send this signal to the user via sms.

To activate the sms notifications, Twilio is used to authenticate the verified number of the user.

Also a percentage decline or increase is activated to signal when a notification sms will be pushed to the user.
